            <h2><b>Integrate.</b> Liberate. Simplify.</h2>
            Technology alone doesn't give you the freedom or ability to simplify. Many have tried to make web and digital life simpler through better products, novel ideas and new platforms. But we believe that integration of new web technologies, such as HTML5, and the ability to customize your environment is what will give you the freedom to communicate, socialize and imagine. We've combined the best features and functions of hardware, software and social platforms and put it into one Web Operating Environment we call Sphinx. We also made it great looking and easy to use. So whether you want to share parts of your mail, customize your rich media environment or simply listen to music without leaving what you are doing, you can do  it all with Sphinx. All located in one browser of your choice.
<br /><br />
Enjoy improved form and function, enhanced integration and the simple user experience of Sphinx.

            Disappointed by the confusing user experience and weak functionality of many Social Media and 'new generation' web based platforms, we decided to develop a new breed of 'social operating environment' - something that will enable a power user and a working mom, a small business and an enterprise. Everyone will find something of interest in Sphinx - our first platform, ready for launch. Our team is comprised of energetic and dedicated 'do-ers', not just thinkers or philosophers. We've combined skills and experience in advanced development, cool graphics, and financial savvy to launch an ambitious project that can help many, even if we are only beginning with a few.
