        provision. The Terms of Service constitutes the entire agreement
        between you and Nifo and governs your use of the Services,
        superseding any prior agreements between you and Nifo (including,
        but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service). A
        printed version of these Terms of Service and of any notice given in
        electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative
        proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms of Service to the
        same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business
        documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed
        form. Subject to Nifo's ability to amend these Terms of Service,
        they cannot be changed.</P>
    <LI><P>If
        any of the provisions contained in these Terms of Service are
        determined to be void, invalid or otherwise unenforceable by a court
        of competent jurisdiction, that provision shall be enforced to the
        maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of these Terms
        of Service and such determination shall not affect the remaining
        provisions contained herein.</P>
    <LI><P>You
        may not assign these Terms of Service or any of your rights or
        obligations under these Terms of Service to a third party. Subject
        to the foregoing, these Terms of Service shall enure to the benefit
        of and be binding upon you and Nifo and their respective successors
        (including any successor by reason of amalgamation) and assigns.</P>
    <LI><P>You
        agree that if you sue Nifo and do not obtain judgment in your
        favour, you will pay all of Nifo's costs, including reasonable fees
        for in-house and outside legal counsel.</P>
    <LI><P>These
        Terms of Service are governed by the laws of the state of New York
        and the United States, without giving effect to any principles of
        conflicts of laws contained therein, and all disputes or other
        matters arising out of this License will be dealt with by a court of
        competent jurisdiction in the United States. These laws apply to
        your access to or use of the Services, notwithstanding your
        domicile, residency or physical location. The Services are intended
        for use only in jurisdictions where they may lawfully be offered for
        use. You and Nifo specifically disclaim the UN Convention on
        Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.</P>
    <LI><P>It is the express wish of the parties that these Terms of Service and
        all related documents be drawn up in English. </P>
