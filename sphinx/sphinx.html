                Sphinx from nifo is a uniquely integrated social media and web operating environment (we are tired of platforms.) We've combined a new generation of email client, rich media manager, and social media management tools. We've even added an embedded HTML5 rich media player. All components and apps are tightly integrated into one HTML5-based web operating environment (WOE), allowing registered users maximum flexibility and the highest productivity with Social Media Network integration points. Additionally, Sphinx profile settings allow users to customize all features of the platform, including external profiles and 'personas' available in later releases.

            iPhone 5 is just 7.6 millimeters thin. To make that happen, Apple engineers had to think small,
            component by component. They created a nano-SIM card, which is 44 percent smaller than a micro-SIM. They
            also developed a unique cellular solution for iPhone 5. The conventional approach to building LTE into a
            world phone uses two chips — one for voice, one for data. On iPhone 5, both are on a single chip. The
            intelligent, reversible Lightning connector is 80 percent smaller than the 30-pin connector. The 8MP
            iSight camera has even more features — like panorama and dynamic low-light mode — yet it’s 20 percent
            smaller. And the new A6 chip is up to 2x faster than the A5 chip but 22 percent smaller. Even with so
            much inside, iPhone 5 is 20 percent lighter and 18 percent thinner than iPhone 4S.
            When we envisioned the new iPhone, we landed on a remarkably thin and light design. But it’s nearly
            impossible to make a device so thin and so light without sacrificing features or performance.
            We could have taken the easy way out and designed something more reasonable and less remarkable. But we
            didn’t. If the technology didn’t exist, we invented it. If a component wasn’t small enough, we
            re-imagined it. If convention was standing in the way, we left it behind. The result is iPhone 5: the
            thinnest, lightest, fastest iPhone ever.

            Our newest product launched from the nifo R&D Center is the Sphinx Eye. This rich media player is available throughout the web because of the new HTML5 technology and is completely integrated into any web browser based environment. Sphinx Eye allows you to choose where to position the player inside of a browser window. Sphinx Player is an all - inclusive rich media player able to understand and manage 100s of rich media formats, while helping users with format conversion tools.
